# C# Workshops

This contains 'workshops' / 'exercises' I think are good to learn concepts. I have probably adapted them from some other resource to use C# syntax.

You will get the most out of this if you actually follow the examples in your IDE while reading it.

Please open an issue if something is not clear or could be improved.
